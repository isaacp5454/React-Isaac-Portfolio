# React-Isaac-Portfolio

## Description

This is my portfolio where you see my progression with coding! My motivation to create this portfolio was so I can be employed by future employees as they see my portfolio built from scratch. I built this project in order to display my creative and professional skills on display. The problem this portfolio solves is that it shows my work to an employer while showing off my web applications appearance and functionality. When you click on any of my work links, it will then nagivate your browser into a new tab of the website. . I believe my portfolio stands out because it showcases my ability to build a website from scratch and nagivates my work into new tabs with the target attribute. 

## Installation
You can first clone the project using GIT and then after that you can run the index.html file.
